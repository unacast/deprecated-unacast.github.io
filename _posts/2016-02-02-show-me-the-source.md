## Small update

I've gotten a question about how the code 
backing our ["Personal Theme song"]({% post_url 2015-12-14-personal-theme-song %}) looks. As you may remember this is a small side project at the Unacastle where we use the beacon-interaction-webhook-feature of the [Writeup](https://writeup.com/) app to get our own Personal Theme songs played when we enter the office in the morning.

Below you can see a small Gist of it's two main parts; the `handler.clj` handling the webhook call from [Writeup](https://writeup.com/) 
and the `app.js` running on the RaspberryPi that plays the correct mp3 when it receives a websocket message.

The url of the websocket and our ids has been redacted to protect the innocent.
